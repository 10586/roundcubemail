Push plugin for Roundcube

Roundcube plugin that provides support for live updates in mail user interface
by utilizing push notifications functionality of IMAP servers.


ARCHITECTURE
------------

The old solution for instant notifications in mailboxes is IMAP IDLE. This has however a big limitation
which is a need to use a separate IMAP connection for every folder.

Recent versions of Dovecot and Cyrus IMAP provide APIs that could be used and might be better than IDLE. For example:

- https://jmap.io/#push-mechanism
- https://www.cyrusimap.org/imap/concepts/features/event-notifications.html
- https://wiki.dovecot.org/Plugins/PushNotification

The plugin contains two components:

1. HTTP service that handles connections from imap notification services and passes them
   to the frontend (with some format conversion logic).
2. Websocket client (frontend) that receives signals from the service and updates the UI.


REQUIREMENTS
------------

The service uses Swoole extension for PHP (https://www.swoole.co.uk/).


INSTALLATION
------------

1. Rename config.inc.php.dist to config.inc.php in the plugin folder.
   For available configuration options see config.inc.php.dist file.
2. Enable the plugin in Roundcube config.
3. Start the service (`php server.php`).
   Note: You can move the file to a different location, but make sure to set INSTALL_PATH constant
   to Roundcube location.


NOTES
-----

1. It should be executed with the same user as Roundcube, so it can have access to logs dir.
2. It does not work with session_storage=php.
